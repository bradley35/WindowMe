# WindowMe
This app was meant for a classroom setting and allows one user (a teacher) to stream their screen to a large audience (students). The main user needed to download a mac app that would stream their screen to the server. They would then be given a code that students could enter into the website to view the class. The streaming is done by uploading a steady stream of jpeg files which are then downloaded by viewers. This is extremely innefficient, but did work.

The server files are in /server and run on Apache Tomcat

The mac app files are in /mac
